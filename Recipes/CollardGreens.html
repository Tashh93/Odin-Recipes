        <p>I would have to say, this is one of my all time <mark>FAVORITE</mark>meals to eat! Although it is served all year round I love them around the cool holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. </p>
        <p>I know there are many ways to make collard greens, but the way that I am going to show you is <mark>DEFINITELY</mark> worth a try!</p>
        <p>The main ingredients you are going to need are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 small bunches of collard greens</li>
            <li>1 Extra large smoked ham hock</li>
            <li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp bacon grease</li>
            <li>1 tbsp seasoned salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp worcheshire sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tsp Crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 paprika</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finely chopped onions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are the steps to make it:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by pulling and tearing greens away from stems. Take a hand full of greens, roll them up and cut the rolls horizontally into small pieces. We personally remove the stems but this is a personal decision.</li>
            <li>Next, add greens to empty clean sink and wash them removing all grit, sand and debris thoroughly with cold water until water becomes clear.</li>
            <li>Next rinse the ham hock very well then add to a large pot along with enough water to fully submerge the ham hock then cover with a lid. Cook over medium high heat for about 45 minutes or until ham hock is near being tender.
            </li>
            <li>Once ham hock is almost tender, add greens and about 4-5 additional cups of water or enough to just barely cover greens to the pot. This will become your pot likker.</li>
            <li>Add along the rest of the ingredients to the pot and cook while covered for at least 2 hours or until completely tender. Most water should have evaporated by this point just having enough to barely cover the greens.</li>

        </ol>
